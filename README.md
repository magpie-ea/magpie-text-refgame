# Text-based version of a reference game

This experiment is a text-only version of a standard reference game, which was originally used to motive the Rational Speech Act modeling framework.
Being entirely text-based means that states are presented via verbal descriptions, not pictures.
In this way, it is possible to use the same stimuli for humans and LLMs.

### Implementation

The experiment is implemented in [magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/).

### Live version

# Text-based version of a reference game

This experiment is a text-only version of a standard reference game, which was originally used to motive the Rational Speech Act modeling framework.
Being entirely text-based means that states are presented via verbal descriptions, not pictures.
In this way, it is possible to use the same stimuli for humans and LLMs.

### Implementation

The experiment is implmented in [magpie](https://magpie-experiments.org/).

First, set up the project with `npm install`

To run the project locally, run `npm run serve`

To build the project for deployment (e.g. to Netlify), run `npm run build`

If you are hosting this repository on github, the project will automatically be built and deployed to the gh-pages branch, so you only have to enable Github Pages in your repository settings to publish your project.

For more information, see the [manual](https://magpie-experiments.org/).
